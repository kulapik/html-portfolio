<h1>The best movies according to David </h1>
<h2>I'm not an usual movie watcher, but these are the ones that I liked</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Up</h3>
<p>A really beautiful movie, the beginning was very emotional and the movie was lots of fun.</p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>Fun superhero romp, one of the few of this genre I've watched however.</p>
<h3>Bridge to Terabithia</h3>
<p>I only watched it once and that was enough for me to be my favorite. Bring tissues though.</p>
